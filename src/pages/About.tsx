                Matcha Days represents slow, intentional creativity and gentle aesthetics. It's about finding beauty in quiet moments, 
                creating art that soothes, and designing music covers that feel like a warm embrace.

                This space celebrates the intersection of visual art and music, where each piece is crafted with care, 
                inspired by soft mornings, garden walks, and the comforting ritual of making matcha tea.

              <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
                I'm an artist who finds joy in both illustration and music design. My work is influenceds by nature, 
                pastel color palettes, and the peaceful energy of slow living.

              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                Through Matcha Days, I share my illustrations, music cover designs, and reflections on the creative process, 
                hoping to create a cozy corner of the internet where art and calm coexist.
